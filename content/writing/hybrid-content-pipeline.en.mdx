This article demonstrates the mixed pipeline: writing in files, catalog data in messages, and runtime interaction data in Upstash or database services.

## Why this split works

Writing is long-form and benefits from markdown authoring tools. Project and toolbox cards are structured catalogs and stay simple in localized json files.

The split keeps routing stable and avoids large refactors.

## Fallback contract

When a slug exists in `content/writing`, the page reads mdx first. If a file is missing, it falls back to `messages/*.json` so current pages do not break.

This makes rollout and rollback predictable.
